For some background, I’m an undergrad student pursuing a computer science degree. I have some pretty passive experience with coding and computers and just building things in general (Lego Mindstorms Represent!), but I haven’t focused any of my abilities into something specific until now. Besides a few throwaway projects, my background is pretty sparse. This is where this blog comes in!

Right now I’m pursuing a career in Cybersecurity. This blog is going to help me document my processes for certain projects, and give me a platform to talk about my learned skills to anyone who might be willing to listen. To anyone who’s still reading, I’m so happy to have you here! I hope my posts help you learn and understand any new concepts, or at least give you a bit of a laugh..
