To start, I should explain exactly how I'm studying for this exam and what materials I'm using. Proper links will be provided to each resource including the cost to use them (if there is any). 

One thing that is free and that everyone should do is download the exam objectives and follow along with them, as they'll help you see where your strengths and weaknesses are during practice quizzes/exams and study for them accordingly.

## Note-Taking

For note taking I am using [Professor Messer's free IT training](https://www.professormesser.com/) videos for the 220-1101 and 220-1102 Cores. The videos are short and sweet, but do take me roughly a day or so to get through due to my slow notetaking style, something I hope to improve upon during my learning journey. I like Professor Messer's videos not only because they're free, but also because he hits every subject of each Exam Objective in a quick and easy to digest way. However because of the way the videos are formatted I wouldn't recommend using them on their own. 

I can assume any cram book would probably work just fine, but I chose to use the [CompTIA A+ Exam Cram Book](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B09VBYN99L/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_d_asin_title_o00?ie=UTF8&psc=1) by David L. Prowse. Prowse goes into a lot of depth with his cram book, covering both Core 1 and Core 2 concepts. Every subject is broken down to it's simplest understanding and gives real-world examples pertaining to each. He also includes figure photos and illustrations, which helps me recognize parts now and not for the very first time while I'm gutting an old Acer laptop. At the end of each chapter is also a short quiz testing your understanding of the topics discussed. The answer key afterwards thoroughly explains why something was the right answer, and why you may have gotten it wrong during the quiz. Lastly, I have a soft spot for textbooks that try to be funny. The book is $30 for the kindle version, and about $50 for a paperback copy on Amazon.   

User [u/m3andaa](https://www.reddit.com/user/m3andaa/) on reddit was also kind enough to post her own notes onto Quizlet! Please be sure to give her thanks, as they help out immensely while studying!

## Quizzes and Tests

For Practice Quizzes, I haven't actually decided on what site to use. I do have a couple of options for when the time comes:

### [Certlibrary](https://www.certlibrary.com/)

Completely free. You have to sign up to their website in order to get full access to their exams, but the exams themselves seem to go very in-depth. Their 1101 exam alone is exactly 216 questions. If you want to pay for Premium access, which is just extra test prep materials, it'll cost you about 30 bucks a year. The practice exams themselves have no paywall.

### Jason Dion

These are...really, really hard. Dion's exams cover absolutely everything there is to know about the official exam, but also tend to go outside the scope of the exam objectives. This can be good if you want to assure total mastery over all objectives, but bad if you're on a time crunch/are struggling with the extra topics. These exams are undoubtably good quality, though some of the information on them is out of date, so keep that in mind. The [Core 1](https://www.udemy.com/course/comptia-a-220-1101-core-1-practice-exams-new-for-2022/) and [Core 2](https://www.udemy.com/course/comptia-a-220-1102-core-2-practice-exams-new-for-2022/) exams are available on Udemy for...varying prices, but at the time of writing this article they're about $12 a piece. If you use Udemy's personal plan for around $17 a month, you get both exam sets for free.

### [Crucial Exams](https://crucialexams.com/)

Another free alternative. I haven't used the website itself, but I've heard in the CompTIA subreddit that it's a good option if you don't like any of the others. Flashcards are also available to help you memorize terms and definitions, and at the time of writing there are 7 hand-on labs ready-to-go.

### [ExamCompass](https://www.examcompass.com/)

Also offers free practice tests with a score report after every attempt. I think it's good for fast-tracking your progress if you're unsure how much you actually understand.

In the end, I don't think it's a bad thing if you used multiple practice sites simultaneously. I'm probably going to wind up doing the same thing.

## Labs

If you don't have a computer of your own to dismember or work in a repair environment, getting hands-on experience can be an absolute nightmare. Not only for the PBQ's at the beginning for the exams, but also for when you actually get into the field and have to start fixing other people's systems. There are virtual labs for this very thing available, but they're pretty pricey depending one where you go. Below I have a list of labs that I've found from most to least expensive:

### [CertMaster Labs](https://www.comptia.org/training/certmaster-labs/a)

These labs come in at a whopping $962, no exam vouchers, study guides, or anything else included. Obviously I'm not your mom, but if I was, I'd tell you to pick any other option besides this to save your wallet. This comes from the official CompTIA website, so you'd know for sure that the information was updated and accurate, but also....why? Again, not your mom, but read this in your mom and/or dad's tone of voice: Don't do it.

### [TestOut](https://testoutce.com/products/comptia-a-plus-year-training)

Incredibly detailed and well thought out labs. They're pretty pricey at about $349/year, but if you care about making sure every detail is correct and that you have the most accurate understanding of the material as possible, it's probably worth it. The website also comes with a 7 day free trial, so you don't have to commit to anything right away ~~or you could just speedrun all the lab resources in a week if you really didn't want to pay.~~ 
Additionally TestOut has an $89/month (or $949/year) option where you get access to their entire library of labs, tests, study materials, etc. for every available certification. This is technically cheaper than going with Mike Meyer's Total Seminars website, but I'm leaving it here due to the initial starting price for accessing only one section.

### [101Labs](https://www.101labs.net/courses/comptia-a/)

These labs are about $174/year, and they focus less on physical installation/repair of devices and more on the software and network side of things. They're a great option if you already have a strong understanding of physical PC repairs! The website also grants you access to several practice tests and exam questions.

### [Total Seminars](https://www.totalsem.com/store/category/comptia-a-simulation-training/)

The price here tends to go up with the amount of extra options you take, the cheapest option at $99/year for just the labs themselves. There's over 240 available and up-to-date labs for practice, so it'll definitely be money well spent. If you want to go with any of the more expensive options, you'll get additional features such as practice tests, e-book guides, and even an exam voucher + retake with the $330/year option.

## Exam Venue

I...don't really have a recommendation or any sort of cohesive list of pros and cons here. Just go with whatever floats your boat. I've had repeatedly bad experiences with the Pearson Online Testing site, so I plan on taking the exam in-person. Billy Boy John to my direct left however probably enjoys the Online Testing site so much that he prefers it. And Sally Mae, who's a little forward but still to the right of me can probably only take the exam online due to extenuating circumstances, like a disability, or test anxiety, or something. There's no correct or recommended way to test, just go with what you think is best. 

There's only one piece of advice I can offer for each option. If you're going Online: Make sure that all your software is up to date, you have a clear mic/video feed, and wherever you're going is quiet and barren. Some exam proctors are super sticklers over test environments and whatnot, so don't leave any room for misunderstandings if you can help it.

If you're going In-Person, an easy way to calm your nerves would be to walk around and view the testing facility before actually going in. I tend to get anxious during official exams such as this one, so familiarizing myself with the environment beforehand makes my thyroid hormones stop doing stupid things (I think? I don't know, I took like one anatomy class in high school).

No matter what, above anything else, try to keep a cool head during the test. Even if you fail, it isn't the end of the world, because you'll be able to try again and do even better than before. Please be patient with yourself, drink plenty of water, and get plenty of rest.

So...That's about it. I'm realizing that I'm talking less about the options that I'm using and more about options that are widely available, but that's mostly because I still wasn't decided on certain topics myself. I hope between the inane sidenotes that anyone reading this found my post useful. Remember, believe in yourself! You've got this <3
